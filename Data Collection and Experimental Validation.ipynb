When analyzing the video using tracker, sometimes the marker gets lost due to lower constrast or fast video rate, in this case we have to manually tag the marker and this would introduce error. In addition, by manually set the coordinate and calibration stick in tracker, error might also happen. Another source of error is after playing several rounds with our prototype, some joints are bent too often that it gets soften and the properties change a little bit. Last, in our simulation, we use two segments of spring to model the leaf spring. With this setup, the initial angles of the spring is coupled with the locations of the spring and the kinematic in our simulation is different to the real case (initial angles in simulation is from contact points to the middle of the spring while in real case it's not).\n","\n","2. When analyzing our videos, we try to mark the precise location of the origin, ground link, and lissed markers. For the softened joint/link, we cut a new spring using the same material and dimension to avoid softened spring but for the device itself, there's not much we can do.\n","\n","3. When doing the experiment, we might inevitably apply a little force while releasing the device but in simulation there's no external force. In addition, the difference in our spring model and the real spring is not controllable.\n","\n","4. Beside using tracker software, we can use other more precise methods like using mocap system.\n","\n","5. The maximum movement is quite similar between experiment and simulation results. Both reach around 0.25 (m). However, other results are really different. The settling time of the simulation is 5 times higher than in experiment. Plus, the settling x position also has around 0.05 (m) difference.\n","\n","6. Instead of just have a two-segments beam with one spring connecting them in our model, we can add spring at the attached points between the modeled-spring and our main device which would give us more precise result. Or we can add more segments instead of two so the model is closer to the real leaf spring.\n","\n","7. To achieve the proposed modification in question 6, the simulation time would increase a lot because of the complexity of the model. In addition, the initial representation of the kinematic would be more complicated."]}]}
