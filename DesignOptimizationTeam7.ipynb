Performance Measurement**\n","\n","_a. Explain, in words, how your team will evaluate the success of your robot’s design. This could be by measuring the forces produced by your design, the speed at which it walks, its thrust:weight ratio, the height it can jump, etc. Explain, in words, how you will measure performance in simulation - Chien can you help explaining?. How will you measure performance in experiments?_\n","\n","  To evaluate the performance of our device we will be measuring the speed and the rate of elongation of the prototype. Other factors we are considering are the time of retraction and the force and velocity of the end effector. To measure the performance of the device we will be using the \"Tracker\" software to analyze the motion of the top bar and the velocity of the end effector closing mechanism. To determine the force of the end effector we will use a spring attached at the end of the end effector and measure the displacement between its original and final position.\n","\n","\n","_b. Are experimental vs. simulation metrics similar or vastly different? If different, how will you equate  with ?_\n","\n","  Our prediction is that the metrics will be similar. If different we will review the simulation code and try to identify if the issue is in the scaling factor or in the geometry of the model.\n","\n","_c. Do you have more than one performance metric you must use as for design goals? If so, either identify the most important one or explain how you will balance two competing criteria. For example, if you need a robot to jump high AND far, which is more important, or how do you establish a relationship between these two possibly competing goals?_\n","\n","  We have 2 performance goals which is the velocity of the end effector to reach it's final position and the force of the end-effector to grasp. The two performance metrics are mutually exclusive, therefore, there isn't a most important one.
